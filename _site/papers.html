              <h3>Dynamic Pose Diagnosis with BlazePose and LSTM for Spinal Dysfunction Risk Estimation</h3>
            </div>
            <p class="project-desc">The bodily movements of a person can be heavily restricted because of a spinal cord disorder. These disorders could be a result of various internal or external factors but we believe that a preliminary diagnostic for the magnitude of the spinal dysfunction can be determined by the movement of the patient itself. The behavioural patterns of a person doing specific tasks with spinal dysfunction varies from someone who does the same tasks with a healthy back. <br><br>In this contribution, we demonstrate that this difference can be generalised and then implemented to predict the spinal health index of the patients with only but an input video of them performing predetermined tasks. <br><br>Our system features a novel technique of abstracting dynamic heat-map as the sequential input to the custom LSTM model. Allowing us to outperform previous techniques by reaching 98.4% validation accuracy with a realtime computational complexity of < 11 milliseconds.</p>

              <h3>Vehicle Speed Detection Using Multi-Branch Networks From Temporal Image Pairs</h3>
            </div>
            <p class="project-desc">Vehicle Speed Detection is important for traffic monitoring and surveillance. But very little research has been done on techniques that don't require specialist hardware or hand-crafted image processing method on video streams. <br><br>This paper presents a novel end-to-end learning-based system that utilizes a multi-branched network architecture to estimate the speed of any vehicle from only two time-varied, unprocessed, images. The system also propose an optimized approach for generating a ground truth dataset by creating an estimation method for a 3D Rendering Engine. And further, propose a very computationally cheap method of extracting license plates by custom training a YOLOv4 tiny architecture in tflite format and Tesseract OCR. <br><br>The proposed low-cost system is easily implementable in the existing infrastructure and provides a lightweight performance with computation time of < 101.58 ms on average and accuracy of 97.3% in a wide range of applications.</p>
